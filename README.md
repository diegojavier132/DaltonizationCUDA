# CEPARCO Group 6 Intergrating Project

## Milestone #2 7/5/2024

We have created a sample program (DaltonizationPython.py) to test the algorithm in a practical use and to have a something to compare later on in the process. The regular python program utilizes the LMS Daltonization using Python libraries OpenCV and NumPy. Using NumPy by itself is considered to be slow due to it running on the CPU and can only utilize multi-threading in some applications. Having this will help with the development of the final program since there is an output to make comparisons and adjust accordingly.
